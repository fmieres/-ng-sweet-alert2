# AngularJS wrapper for SweetAlert2

AngularJS wrapper for [SweetAlert2](https://limonte.github.io/sweetalert2/). Sweet Alert2 is a beautiful replacement for Javascript's "Alert".

Original work made by [http://oitozero.github.io/ngSweetAlert/](http://oitozero.github.io/ngSweetAlert/).

I changed it to make it work with SweetAlert2 since Sweet Alert has been discontinued.
